# TWITTER CLONE
The project began as a challenge from our instructor Jason to try and figure out how Twitter started on Rails. 

As part of our Rails course, we've had to try and figure out how some popular apps were created using Rails. My first attempt was a blog-type app, and this app is my second attempt at Rails, this time using scaffolding and gems (namely Devise and Carrierwave). The app is supposed to function as a clone of the early version of Twitter.

## Updates

As of 22 Jul 2017 | So far, I have the simplest, barest bones there are. I've finished the basic functionality of the app -- Signing up and logging in, updating the user's profile, deleting an account, assigning tweets to specific users, and uploading an avatar. I've yet to create the design, but the basics are there. I hope to add a tweet counter and to be able to arrange the tweets properly for my next update, and of course the design.

As of 24 Jul 2017 | I've been able to add a better navbar, format the tweets better, and display an avatar for every user. I haven't figured out how to create a profile yet, and the overall design is lacking. I also haven't set up the function to be able to upload images with the tweet (or as a tweet). 

As of 25 Jul 2017 | I've temporarily hit pause on this project to work on an Instagram Clone -- https://github.com/arencrg/instaclone


## To-do

- crop images into squares (so that they can be displayed as circles, like in the current, rounder Twitter)
- the design (CSS) -- I've been putting this off for so long, hahaha
- following/followers, and probably a Tweet counter
- Log in with Facebook (OmniAuth)
