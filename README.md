# TWITTER CLONE

This app is my second attempt at Rails, this time using scaffolding and gems (namely Devise and Carrierwave). The app is supposed to function as a clone of the early version of Twitter.

## Updates

As of 22 Jul 2017, I've finished the basic functionality of the app -- Signing up and logging in, updating the user's profile, deleting an account, assigning tweets to specific users, and uploading an avatar. I've yet to create the design, but the basics are there. I hope to add a tweet counter and to be able to arrange the tweets properly for my next update, and of course the design.

As of 24 Jul 2017, I've been able to add a better navbar, format the tweets better, and display an avatar for every user. I haven't figured out how to create a profile yet, and the overall design is lacking. Will finish within the week.
